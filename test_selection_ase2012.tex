% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

\begin{abstract}
As security requirements of software often change, developers may modify access control policies (policies in short) according to evolving requirements. 
To increase confidence that the modification of policies is correct, developers conduct regression testing. However, rerunning all of existing system test 
cases could be costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, we develop a regression-test-selection approach, which selects every system test case 
that may reveal faults caused by policy changes. However, selected test cases may not evaluate (i.e., cover) all the rules impacted by policy changes. 
To address this issue, we develop a test augmentation technique by generating additional test cases to cover the rules that are not covered by existing test cases.
Our evaluation results show that our test selection techniques reduce a significant number of system test cases efficiently and our test 
augmentation technique is effective to generate additional test cases. 

\Comment{
As security requirements of software often change during software development and maintenance, developers may modify policies according to evolving requirements.
%For example, new security requirements include new security concerns to be added into a policy.
%Developers may change policies without changing program code related to actual system functionality.
In order to increase confidence that the modification of policies is correct and does not introduce unexpected behavior, developers conduct regression testing.
For regression testing, rerunning all of existing system test cases could be costly and time-consuming, especially for large-scale systems.
To address this issue, we propose an efficient regression-test-selection approach, which selects every test case that may reveal a fault caused by policy changes. 
Our approach includes three techniques: The first one is based on mutation analysis (that converts each rule's decision in turn and executes and finds test cases related to each rule), 
The second one is based on coverage analysis (that records which rules are evaluated by executing each test case), and The third one is based on evaluated decisions of requests 
issued from test cases.
However, selected test cases may not evaluate (i.e., cover) all of modified policy behaviors,
which are induced by rules impacted by policy change.
To address this issue, we propose a test augmentation technique.
The technique modifies existing test cases 
to generate additional test cases
to cover not-covered but impacted rules with existing test cases.
We evaluate our approach on three real world Java programs each interacting with policies. 
%Our evaluation results show that our test selection techniques achieve
%82\%-97\% and 51\%-83\% of test reduction for a modified version with 5 and 25 policy changes,
%respectively.
Our evaluation results show that our test selection techniques reduce up to 51\%$\sim$97\% of test reduction for a modified version with given 5$\sim$25 policy changes.
%5 rules change.
%find XX test cases from existing test cases, which covers only XX\% of impacted rules on average. 
Our evaluation results show that our test augmentation technique generates additional test cases to cover 100\% of the impacted rules.

%\section{Acknowledgments}
%This section is optional; it is a location for you
%to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
%what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
%authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
%his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
%and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{yangtse,yangtse2}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references

%%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%\subsection{Conclusions}
%\subsection{Acknowledgments}
%\subsection{Additional Authors}
%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the
%\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% This next section command marks the start of
%% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%\section{More Help for the Hardy}
%The acm\_proc\_article-sp document class file itself is chock-full of succinct
%and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%it useful but please remember not to change it.
