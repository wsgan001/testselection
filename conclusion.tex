\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We make three key contributions in this paper. First, we proposed three test selection techniques for access control policy evolution. 
To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one for automatic test-selection approach in context of policy
evolution. Second, we presented a test augmentation technique to generate test cases that cover not-covered
policy changes by existing test cases. Third, we conduct evaluation with few test metrics to measure the effectiveness of our approach and the efficiency of our three test selection
techniques.
The evaluation results demonstrated that our approach is effective to select test cases for test reduction.
Among the proposed three test-selection techniques, the evaluation results demonstrated that the technique based recorded
request evaluation is the most efficient compared with the first two techniques. Besides, we also achieve 100\% coverage
of changed policy behaviors with augmented test cases.

%our paper is the ?rst one for automatic correction of ?rewall policy faults. Last, we implemented our approach
%and evaluated its effectiveness on real-life ?rewalls. To
%measure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose
%two metrics, which we believe are general metrics for
%measuring the effectiveness of ?rewall policy correction
